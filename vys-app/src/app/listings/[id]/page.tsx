// This page will render the listing details for the given ID
// and will use the ListingModels component to display the models associated with that listing.
// The ListingModels component is expected to handle fetching and displaying the models for the listing ID provided.
// Ensure that the ListingModels component is properly implemented to fetch and display the models.
// You can also add error handling or loading states as needed in the ListingModels component.
// This page is part of a Next.js application and will be rendered on the server side.
// Make sure to test the page by navigating to /listing/[id] in your application.
// You can also add additional styling or layout components as needed for your application.
// If you need to fetch additional data or perform actions based on the listing ID,
// you can do so within the ListingModels component or by using Next.js data fetching methods like getServerSideProps or getStaticProps.
// If you want to add more functionality, consider implementing features like:
// - Displaying listing details such as title, description, and images.
// - Allowing users to interact with the listing, such as liking or commenting.
// - Adding pagination or filtering options for the models associated with the listing.
// - Implementing SEO optimizations for better search engine visibility.
// - Ensuring accessibility standards are met for better user experience.
